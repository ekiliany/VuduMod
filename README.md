List of major changes to be made:

o	Brightness shoots up whenever aiming down sights. This is the #1 issue that needs solved before the scope is truly usable. Have solutions in mind to test soon.

o	!!!SOLVED!!!! Scope PiP and 2D now match decently, but now the scope is effectively zooming out a bit at 1x as opposed to matching 1:1 with unscoped world scale. This is issue #2 right behind the brightness stuff. Need to figure out how to balance all of this out so 2D and PiP are both true 1x

o	Colliders need to be added. Just got too deep in tweaking functionality and left this behind momentarily. This has already been done for the Vortex scope, so will be easy to complete ASAP.

o	Textures needs more metalness or something. I like the current texture but it looks so much different from the other scopes and weapon assets, and my evaluation is it looks less metal? Something is definitely missing, tbd what to do here.

o	Actual Vudu reticle needs to be added. This is less important to the immediate usability/testing, but a high priority once everything is working as intended and the textures are up to spec.

o	Parallax effects and potentially the PiP settings need to be tweaked to make moving while ADS to feel a bit more real.

o	Eventual transition to using the Bacon illuminated PiP scope object. IRL the reticle is illuminated and it looks awesome, so this will be important for both fidelity + cool factor. Not important at all in the short-run.
